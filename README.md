# ATM-Simulator

Project description: 
The objective of the project is to build an application to replicate the functionality of an ATM Machine, in Python programming.

The balance is Rs 10,000 as it is a sample application, without access to real accounts.

You need to include the basic functionalities such as Entering the PIN, Check Balance, Withdraw Amount, Deposit and Exit from the ATM machine.

The input for the application from the user is to enter the PIN and then ask the user to select an appropriate option from the defined functionalities and perform it accordingly then show the output on the screen.

The below is the sample output, expected from the ATM Simulator Functionality.

***** Welcome To ATM Machine Simulator *****
         
Enter Your Pin: (For eg- 25566)

After entering the PIN you will get these options
            Options you can Exercise are:
            1) Balance
            2) Withdraw
            3) Deposit
            4) Exit.

Once you get select the option, the program will command you according to that.
